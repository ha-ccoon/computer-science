## Chapter 6. Fruitful functions

### 6.1 Return values

```
e = math.exp(1.0)
height = radius * math.sin(radians)
```

The functions we have written are **void**. Casually, they have **no return value**; the return value is **None**.

In this chapter, we are going to write fruitful functions. 

```
def area(radius):
    a = math.pi * radius**2
    return a
```

We have seen the return statement before, but in a fruitful function the return statement includes an **expression**.

- This statement means: "Return immediately from this function and use the following expression as a return value."
- temprary variables like `a` can make debugging easier.

The expression can be arbitrarily complicated, so we could have written this function more concisely:

```
def area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius**2
```

It also useful to have multiple return statements, one in each branch of a conditional:

```
def absolute_value(x):
    if x < 0:
	return -x
    else:
	return x
```

Since these return statements are in an alternative conditional, only one runs.

- As soon as a return statement runs, the function terminates without executing any subsequent statements.
- **Dead code**: code that appears after a return statement, or any other place the flow of execution can never reach.

> ðŸ”¥ In a fruitful function, it is a good to ensure that every possible path through the program hits a **return statement**.

```
def absolute_vallue(x):
    if x < 0:
	return -x
    if x > 0:
	return x
```

- This function is incorrect because if x happens to be 0, neither condition is true, and the function ends without hitting a return statement.
- If the flow of execution gets to the end of a function, the return value is None, which is not the value of 0.

As an exercise, write a compare function that takes two values, x and y, and returns 1 if x > y, 0 if x == y, and -1 if x < y.

```
def compare(x, y):
    if x > y:
	return 1
    elif x == y:
	return 0
    else x < y:
	return -1
```

### 6.2 Incremental development

As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.

- **Incremental development**: the goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.

![1695249087614](image/ch6/1695249087614.png)The first step is to consider what a distance function should look lie in Python. In other words,what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?

- In this case, the inputs are two points, which represent using four numbers.
- The return value is the distance represented by a floating-point value.

  ```
  def distance(x1, x2, y1, y2):
      return 0.0
  ```
- Obviously, this version doesn't compute distances; it always returns zero. But it's syntatically correct, and it runs.
- You can test it before you make it more complicated.

To test the new function, call it with sample arguments:

```
distance(1, 2, 4, 6)
>>> 0.0
```

- These values will have horizontal distance of 3 and the vertical distance of 4; that way, the result is 5, the hypotenus of a 3-4-5 right triangle.
- When testing a function, it's good to know the right answer.

At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntatically correct, and we can start dadding code to the body. A next step is to find the differences `x2 - x1` and `y2 - y1`.

```
distance(1, 2, 4, 6)
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    print('dx is', dx)
    print('dy is', dy)
    return 0.0
```

- If the function is working, it should display `dx` is 3 and `dy` is 4.
- If so, we know that the function is getting the right arguments and performing the first computation correctly.
- If not, there are only a few lines to check.

Next, we compute the sum of squares of dx and dy:

```
distance(1, 2, 4, 6)
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    print('dsquared is', dsquared)
    return 0.0
```

Finally, you check the complete result of this function:

```
distance(1, 2, 4, 6)
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    result = math.sqrt(dsquared)
    return result
```

If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to print the value of result before the `return` statement.

The final version of the function doesn't display anything when it runs; it only returns a value.

- The print statements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once you get the function working, you should remove them.
- **Scaffolding**: it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the final product.

The key aspects of the process are the below.

1. Start with a working program and make small ingremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.
2. Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.
3. Once the program is working, you need to remove the scaffolding or consolidate mutiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program difficult to read.

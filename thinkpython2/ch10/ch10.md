## Chapter 10. Lists

### 10.1 A list is a sequence

Like a string, a list is a **sequence** of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in a list are called **elements** or sometimes **items**.

There are several ways to create a new list.

- The simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets. The first example is a list of four integers and the second is a list of three strings.

  ```
  [10, 20, 30, 40]
  ['crunchy frog', 'ran bladder', 'lark vomit']
  ```
- The elements of a list don't have to be the same type. A list within another list is **nested**.

  ```
  ['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]
  ```

### 10.2 Lists are mutable

The syntax fpr accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters of a string - t**he bracket operator.** The expression inside the brackets specifies the index.

```
>>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
>>> numbers = [42, 123]
>>> empty = []
>>> print(cheeses, numbers, empty)
['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] [42, 123] []
```

Unlike strings, the lists are **mutable**.

When the bracket operator appears on the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the list that will be assigned.

```
>>> numbers = [42, 123]
>>> numbers[1] = 5
>>> numbers
[42, 5]
```

List indices work the same way as string indices:

- Any integer expression can be used as an index.
- If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an `IndexError.`
- If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.

The in operator also works in lists.

```
>>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
>>> 'Edam' in cheeses
True
>>> 'Brie' in cheeses
False
```

### 10.3 Traversing a list

The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a `for` loop. The syntax is the same as strings.

- When you read a list:

  ```
  for cheese in cheeses:
      print(cheese)
  ```
- When you write or update a list:

  - `len` returns the number of elements in the list.
  - `range` returns a list of indices from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the list.
  - Each time through the loop i gets the index of the next element.
  - The assignment statement in the body uses i to read the old value of the element and to assign the new value.

  ```
  for i in range(len(numbers)):
      numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
  ```

Although a list can contain another list, the nested list still counts as a single element. The length of this list is four.

```
['spam', 1, ['Brie', 'Roquefort', 'Pol le Veq'], [1, 2, 3]]
```

### 10.4 List operations

The + operator concatenates lists:

```
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> c = a + b
>>> c
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

The * operator repeats a list a given number of times:

```
>>> [0] * 4
[0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

### 10.5 List slices

The slice operator also works on lists:

```
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> t[1:3]
['b', 'c']
>>> t[:4]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> t[3:]
['d', 'e', 'f']
```

- If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning.
- If you omit the second, the slice goes to the end.
- So if you omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list.

A slice operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple elements:

```
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> t[1:3] = ['x', 'y']
>>> t
['a', 'x', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

### 10.6 List methods

Python provides methods that operate on lists.

- `append`: add a new element to the end of a list.

  ```
  >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
  >>> t.append('d')
  >>> t
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

  ```
- `extend`: takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements.

  ```
  >>> t1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
  >>> t2 = ['d', 'e']
  >>> t1.extend(t2)
  >>> t1
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
  ```
- `sort`: arranges the elements of the list from low to high.

  ```
  >>> t = ['d', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'a']
  >>> t.sort()
  >>> t
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
  ```

Most list methods are **void**; they modify the list and return **None**.

### 10.7 Map, filter and reduce

To add up all the numbers in a list, you can use a loop like this.

```
def add_all(t):
    total = 0
    for x in t:
        total += x
return total
```

- `total` is initialized to 0.
- Each time through the loop, x gets one element from the list.
- The += operator provides a short way to update a variable.

  - This **argumented assignment statement**, as the loop runs, total accumulates the sum of the elements.
  - A variable used this way is sometimes called an **accumulator**.

  ```
  total += x

  is equivalent to

  total = total + x
  ```

Adding up the elements of a list is such a common operation that Python provides it as a built-in function, `sum.`

- An operation like this that combines a sequence of elements into a single value is sometimes called **reduce**.

```
>>> t = [1, 2, 3]
>>> sum(t)
6
```

Sometimes you want to traversen one list while building another.

For example, the following function takes a list of strings and returns a new list that contains capitalized strings.

```
def capitalize_all(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        res.append(s.capitalize())
return res
```

- `res` is initinalized with an empty list.
- Each time through the loop, we append the next element.
- So `res` is another kind of accumulator.

An operation like `capitalize_all` is sometimes called a **map** because it "maps" a function (in this case the method `capitalize`) onto each of the elements in a sequence.

Another common is to select some of the elements of a list and return a sublist.

For example, the following function takes a list of strings and returns a list that contains only the uppercase strings.

```
def only_upper(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        if s.isupper():
            res.append(s)
    return res
```

- `isupper` is a string method that returns `True` if the string contains only upper case letters.
- An operation like `only_upper` is called a **filter** because it selects some of the elements and filters out the others.

Most common list operations can be expressed as a combination of map, filter and reduce.

### 10.8 Deleting elements

There are several ways to elements from a list.

- `pop`: if you know the index of the element you want, you can use `pop`.

  - `pop` modifies the list and returns the element that was removed.
  - If you don't provide an index, it deletes and returns the last element.

  ```
  >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
  >>> x = t.pop(1)
  >>> t
  ['a', 'c']
  >>> x 
  'b'
  ```
- `del`: if you don't need the removed value, you can use `del` operator.

  ```
  >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
  >>> del t[1]
  >>> t
  ['a', 'c']
  ```

  - To remove more than one element, you can use del with a slice index.

    ```
    >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
    >>> del t[1:5]
    >>> t
    ['a', 'f']
    ```
- `remove`: if you know the element you want to `remove` (but not the index), you can use remove.

  - The return value from remove is **None**.

  ```
  >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
  >>> t.remove('b')
  >>> t
  ['a', 'c']
  ```

### 10.9 Lists and strings

A string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence of values, but a list of characters is not the same as a string.

To convert from a string to a list of characters, you can use `list`.

```
>>> s = 'spam'
>>> t = list(s)
>>> t
['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']
```

The list function breaks a string into individual letters. If you want to break a string into words, you can use the `split` method.

```
>>> s = 'pining for the fjords'
>>> t = s.split()
>>> t
['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']
```

- An optional argument called a **delimiter** specifies which characters to use as word boundaries.

  ```
  >>> s = 'spam-spam-spam'
  >>> delimiter = '-'
  >>> t = s.split(delimiter)
  >>> t
  ['spam', 'spam', 'spam']
  ```

`join` is the inverse of split.

- It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements.
- `join` is a string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter.
- In this case the delimiter is a space character, so `join` puts a space between words.
- To concatenate strings without spaces, you can use the empty string, ' ', as adelimiter.

```
>>> t = ['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']
>>> delimiter = ' '
>>> s = delimiter.join(t)
>>> s
'pining for the fjords'
```

### 10.10 Objects and values

If we run these assignment statements:

```
a = 'banana'
b = 'banana'
```

- We know that `a` and `b` both refer to a string, but we don't know whether they refer to the *same* string.
- There are two possible states as you can see from the below state diagram.
  - In one case, `a` and `b` refer to two different objects that have the same value.
  - In the second case, they refer to the same object.

![1696862141358](image/ch10/1696862141358.png)

To check whether two variables refer to the same object, you can use the `is` operator.

```
>>> a = 'banana'
>>> b = 'banana'
>>> a is b
True
```

In this example, Python only created one string object, and both `a` and `b` refer to it. But when you create two lists, you get two objects.

```
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]
>>> a is b
False
```

So the state diagram looks like the following diagram.

![1696862488956](image/ch10/1696862488956.png)

- In this case we would say that the two lists are **equivalent**, because they have the same elements, but not **identical**, because they are not the same object.
- If two objects are identical, they are also equivalent, but if they are equivalent, they are not necessarily identical.

Until now, we have been using "object" and "value" interchangeable, but it is more precise to say that **an object has a value**.

- If you evaluate `[1, 2, 3]`, you set a list object whose value is a sequence of integers.
- If another list has the same elements, we say it has the same value, but it is not the same object.

### 10.11 Aliasing

If a refers to an object and you assign b = a, then both variables refer to the same object:

```
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a
>>> b is a
True
```

- The association of a variable with an object is called a **reference**.

  - In this example, there are two references to the same object.
- An object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that the object is **aliased**.

  - If the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect the other.
  - Although this behavior can be useful, it is *error-prone*. In general, it is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable objects.
  - ```
    >>> b[0] = 42
    >>> a
    [42, 2, 3]
    ```
- For immutable onjects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a problem.

  - In this example, It almost never makes a differnece whether a and b refer to the same string or not.
  - ```
    a = 'banana'
    b = 'banana'
    ```

### 10.12 List arguments

When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. If the function modifies the list, the caller sees the change. 

- For example, `delete_head` removes the first element from a list.
- The parameter `t` and the variable `letters` are aliases for the same object.

```
def delete_head(t):
    del t[0]

>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> delete_head(letters)
>>> letters
['b', 'c']
```

It is important to distinguish operations that modify lists and operations that create new lists.

- For example, the `append` method modifies a list, but the `+ operator` creates a new list.
  - The return value from `append` is None
  - The result of the `+ operator` is a new list, and the original list is unchanged.
- ```
  >>> t1 = [1, 2]
  >>> t2 = t1.append(3)
  >>> t1
  [1, 2, 3]
  >>> t2
  None
  ```
- ```
  >>> t3 = t1 + [4]
  >>> t1
  [1, 2, 3]
  >>> t3
  [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

### 10.13 Debugging

Careless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:

#### Most list methods mofity the argument and return None

- This is the opposit of the string methods, which return a new string and leave the original alone.
- Because sort returns None, the next operation you perform with t is likely to fail.
- Before using list methods and operators, you should read the documentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode.
- ```
  // string
  word = word.strip()

  // list
  t = t.sort()           # WRONG!
  ```

#### Make copies to avoid aliasing

- If you want to use a method list sort that modifies the argument, but you need to keep the original list as well, you can make a copy.

#### Pick an idion and stick with it

Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do things.

- For example, to remove an element from a list, you can use pop, rmove, del, or even a slice assignment.
- To add an element, you can use append method or the + operator.

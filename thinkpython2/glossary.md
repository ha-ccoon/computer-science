### ch 1.

### ch 2.

- expression: A combination of variables, operators, and values that represents a single result.

### ch 3.

### ch 4.

### ch 5.

### ch 6.

- **temporary variable**: a variable used to store an intermediate value in a complex calculation.
- **dead code**: part of a program that can never run, often because is appears after a return statement.
- **incremental development**: a program development plan intended to avoid debugging by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.
- **scaffolding**: code that is used during program development but is not part of the final version.
- **guardian**: a programing pattern that uses a conditional statement to check for and handle circustances that might cause an error.

### ch 7. Iteration

- **iteration**: repeated execution of a set of statements using either a recursive function call or a loop.
- **algorithm**: a general process for solving a category of problems.

### ch 8. Strings

- **sequence**: an ordered collection of values where each value is identified by an integer index.
- **item**: one of the values in a sequence.
- **index**: an integer value used to select an item in a sequence, such as character in a string. In Python, indices start from 0.
- **slice**: a part of a string specified by a range of indices.
- **immutable**: the property of a sequence whose items cannot be changed.
- **traverse**: to iterate through the items in a sequence, performing a similar operation on each.
- **search**: a pattern of traversal that stops when it finds what it is looking for.
- **counter**: a variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and then incremented.
- **invocation**: a statement that calls a method.

### ch 10. Lists

- **list**: a sequence of values
- **accumulator**: a variable used in a loop to add up or accumulate a result.
- **argumented assignment**: a statement that updats the value of a variable using an operator like `+=`.
- **reduce**: a processing pattern that traverses a sequence and accumulates the elements into a single result.
- **map**: a processing pattern that traverses a sequence and performs an operation on each element.
- **filter**: a processing pattern that traverses a list and selects the elements that satisfy some criterion.
- **object**: something a variable can refer to. an object has a type and value.
- **equivalent**: having the same value.
- **identical**: being the same object (which implies equivalence)
- **reference**: the association between  a variable and its value.
- **aliasing**: a circumstance where two or more variables refer to the same object.
- **delimiter**: a character or string used to indicate where a string should be split.
- **reduction**: In mathematics, reduction refers to  **the rewriting of an expression into a simpler form** .
